# Zillow Prize: Zillow’s Home Value Prediction (Zestimate®)

This project is based on the Zillow Prize Kaggle competition, where participants aim to improve the accuracy of Zillow's
Zestimate® algorithm for predicting home values. Below, you'll find an overview of the competition, the objectives of
the project, and the methodology adopted during participation in this challenge.

## Competition Objective

The primary goal of this competition was to build a machine learning model that predicts the **error of the Zestimate**
home value predictions. Instead of predicting the actual home value, the task required forecasting the difference
between the Zillow estimate and the actual sale price of properties.

By building an accurate predictive model, the aim was to help Zillow improve its Zestimate algorithm for better
real-world applications.
